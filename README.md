## TeachCraft - Globalhack Youth Mini-hackathon

A mini-hackathon challenge for students to build something awesome with code in minecraft! A few examples are provided in the .py files to get you started.

The shared multi-player server is located here:
```
199.96.85.3:25570
```

You can also setup your own server (if your computer has the resources) following the optional instructions below.

### Setup

[Setup Client](https://github.com/teachthenet/TeachCraft-Globalhack-Youth/blob/master/setup.md): Get minecraft running, get connected to the server.

[Optional - setup your own server](https://github.com/teachthenet/TeachCraft-Server): If you don't want to use our shared multiplayer server, you can setup your own following these instructions.

### What to build? Consider one of the following options

- Any building/village/city/artistic piece that would have taken forever to build by hand, but is achievable via programming!
- Import images (pixel art) into minecraft - consider using the [library Pillow](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow).
- Instead of printing to a 3d printer, print to your minecraft world!
- Build a mini-game!

- Build an engineering marvel! [Example: Moving Clock](https://github.com/martinohanlon/minecraft-clock/blob/master/minecraft-clock.py)
- Build an animation! [Example: Star Wars Animated](https://github.com/martinohanlon/minecraft-starwars)
- Build some superpower / neat trick! [Example: Auto-bridge](http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/2013/02/raspberry-pi-minecraft-auto-bridge.html) [Link 2](https://github.com/martinohanlon/minecraft-bridge)
